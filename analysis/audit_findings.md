# Firewall Rule Audit Findings

## Identified Issues:

### 1. Rule 1 & Rule 6
- **Redundancy**: Rule 6 is a duplicate of Rule 1.
- **Overly Permissive**: ANY -> ANY on port 80 can expose internal services unnecessarily.

### 2. Rule 2
- Acceptable for HTTPS access from LAN, but no outbound restrictions in place.

### 3. Rule 3
- Good use of source and destination filtering for SSH.

### 4. Rule 4
- **High Risk**: Port 23 (Telnet) is unencrypted and should not be allowed from ANY to ANY.

### 5. Rule 5
- Deny rule provides segmentation, but should be placed strategically to avoid misconfiguration.
