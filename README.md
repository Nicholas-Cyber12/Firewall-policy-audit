# Firewall Policy Audit & Recommendations (Simulated Project)

## Overview
This project simulates a firewall rule audit for a small business. The configuration file was based on common patterns found in FortiGate/Cisco/iptables deployments. The goal was to:

- Identify overly permissive or redundant rules
- Analyze the effectiveness of the current firewall setup
- Propose a more secure and segmented firewall policy following the Principle of Least Privilege

## Skills Demonstrated
- Firewall rule analysis
- Network segmentation principles
- GRC & policy thinking
- Python scripting for rule extraction
- Documentation & policy drafting

## Project Structure
```
data/                → Sample firewall rule config
analysis/            → Rule-by-rule audit findings
recommendations/     → Improved firewall policy proposal
scripts/             → Optional automation (e.g. rule parser)
```

## Note
This is a simulation project designed for training and demonstration purposes. No real networks were accessed.
